# Ayesha-s-Aesthetics
Designed and developed an Aesthetic medspa website using HTML CSS and miss JavaScript. 

Ayesha's Aesthetics includes blog updates in footer with a pink/black/grey/white template theme.

The service list has icons in place of boring old text. 
Hover effect for team member's social media icons/links. 
Would appreciate help in making the "available programs" list into an image carousel
